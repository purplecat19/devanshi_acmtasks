Being selected as a **UI/UX Design Mentee** in a college club recently, and with my growing interest in research, I stumbled upon a blog that couldn’t have been more perfect! This blog combines **UX and Research**, explaining how crucial understanding users’ needs, preferences, and pain points is for a business to make an impact.

## 🔹 Reality Check

The blog starts off with an obvious reality check:  
> “As technology advances, so do users’ needs and expectations.”  

Reading this made me realise that instead of guessing or relying on my own assumptions, I should gather real data through interviews, surveys, and persona creation to see what people actually want or struggle with. I didn’t realise we were supposed to do all that. Reading it made me appreciate how important surveys and ‘majority’ opinions are.

## 🔹 User Observation

The **“User Observation”** part blew my mind. Watching someone interact with a product in their natural environment, noticing **body language, behaviour patterns, and other non-verbal cues** is basically like stalking… but in a good way. It made me think, my font choices, or button placements, and other things I obsess over while making a UI might feel totally different to a real user.

## 🔹 Types of Data Collection

This blog also breaks down data collection into various types like:  

- **Direct** (small group, deep insights) vs **Indirect** (trends in large groups)  
- **Individual** (personal) vs **Group** (more collaborative)  
- **Performance** (what users do) vs **Discussion** (why users do what they do) Methods  

Putting all of these together = Full understanding of how **user experience** can make or break a product, and how to iterate it and make it better by gathering insights from the data we gathered.

## 🔹 Conclusion

As a part of my previously mentioned club’s task, I am reviewing a book called *“Restoring UI”*, and reading this blog really connected the dots for me. It made me realise how design isn’t just **‘guesswork’** or making things look nice, it’s actually about **observing real users, gathering data, drawing insights from it, and then refining it based on users’ behaviour**.  

Putting both the book’s practical tips and this blog’s insights together, taught me how to make decisions that actually help users… and maybe even save me from endless *“does this look right?”* panic spirals! 😅
